Because Hisoutensoku is a P2P based game, players should ideally be close to each other for optimal connections. As a result, there are multiple region-based communities living in different spaces like IRC (though perhaps not anymore these days), Skype and primarily Discord.

This page lists a (definitely incomplete) list of of these regional communities.

_Note: if your region is not listed here, or you are unsure which one is most suitable, please join the international community #hisouten and someone in the chat will help you_ ðŸ™‚
