### Tutorial Video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnW-6c_H6KU

This is a fairly comprehensive tutorial video that goes over the basic mechanics and concepts of the game. It is strongly recommended that you view this video if you are just starting out.

A few additional points not mentioned in the video are:
You can highjump by simply pressing an upwards direction (7/8/9) while holding down the D button. This method is recommended over the usual 27/28/29 method.
You can highjump cancel a grounded bullet attack (such as 5b, 5c, and many skill attacks) ASAP by holding 7/8/9 while firing the bullet.

A slightly less comprehensive text version of the tutorial can be found here:
