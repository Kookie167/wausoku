The pinned information from the Oceania Discord has been extracted into various places on the website. It's definitely a first draft, so if you spot any mistakes, let us know (or better yet, submit a pull request to fix it).

Check out the shiny new [OCE community Homepage](/region/oceania) or the [FAQ](/faq).

There's still much that's missing, but it's a start.
Next we'll be adding a full guide on how to contribute your own content to the website.
