## Notable Add-ons Included in the Download

**SokuRoll** enables the game to utilize rollback netcode for a vastly improved online experience. This will be enabled by default when you launch `th123.exe`, and can be confirmed by looking for [R1.3] in the game window’s title.

**Various practice mode mods** such as hitbox viewer and input viewer. The additional window that pops up when entering an offline mode will display useful information such as frame advantage in real time. For the various hotkeys/instructions on how to use the mods refer to the [FAQ](/FAQ).<!-- TODO: link FAQ to actual question in FAQ -->

**GetIP** will automatically put your IP on your clipboard when hosting without needing to manually look it up and copy it. This will allow you to simply paste your IP:port for an opponent to join without the hassle of looking it up.

**Dpadfix** will allow dpads on controllers/sticks to work natively with the game, removing the need for third party apps like Joy2key. This crashes the game on launch if you are running the game on windows XP, or windows 7 with the basic theme. Drop a line in the [OCE Discord](/region/oceania) if you are on these and we can show you how to disable it.

**Autopunch** will allow you to host without needing to port forward. Simply launch autopunch.win64.exe after launching the game, highlight the game in the list and click punch. If successful the game window will now have `+ autopunch v0.0.2` in its title.
